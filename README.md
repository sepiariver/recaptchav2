# ReCaptchaV2
ReCaptchaV2 (version 3.x) integrates V2 AND V3 of Google's ReCaptcha service into MODX as a FormIt hook.

It can also be used with the Login Extra as a preHook, as of version 1.0.0

Version 2+ updates the base Google Recaptcha class to the latest 1.1.2, including autoloading and cURL support. https://github.com/google/recaptcha

You must generate API keys for your domain here: [https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
and enter them into the System Settings before you can use ReCaptchaV2. NOTE: You must choose V2 or V3 in the ReCaptcha admin, when generating your client keys. You can use both on a single MODX install with this Extraâ€”there are separate system settings for V2 and V3.

### USAGE EXAMPLE:

```
[[!FormIt?
   &hooks=`recaptchav2,email`
   ...
]]
```

OR
```
[[!Login? &preHooks=`recaptchav2`]]
```

You will also need to call the accompanying form element renderer snippet somewhere in your html form, for example:

```
<div class="form-item">
    [[!recaptchav3_render]]
    [[!+fi.error.recaptchav3_error]]
</div>
```

As of 2.3+, you can use the "Invisible Recaptcha" implementation:

```
<form id="login-form">
[[!recaptchav2_render?
    &tpl=`recaptchav2_invisible_html`
    &form_id=`login-form`
]]
</form>
```
In this usage, the "recaptchav2_invisible_html" Chunk renders a button with the necessary data attributes to trigger ReCaptcha. NOTE: the JavaScript implementation in the Chunk requires the `&form_id` to be defined.

The render snippet may or may not be usable as a preHook for FormIt at this time. NOTE: you can customize the behaviour of your ReCaptcha implementation, in accordance with [Google's developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro), by customizing the Chunks used for rendering. You can specify any Chunk in the `&tpl` property of the "recaptchav{n}_render" Snippets.
